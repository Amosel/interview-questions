## Distributed system problems and solutions

1. **Partition Tolerance:** - Handling system operation when network partitions occur, meaning some components can't communicate with others.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Vector Clocks, Merkle Trees
   - Solutions include eventual consistency models and gossip protocols to synchronize data across partitions when they're reachable again.

2. **Consistency:** - Ensuring all nodes in a system see the same data at the same time, even amidst concurrent updates.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Paxos, Raft
   - Solutions involve consensus algorithms to ensure all nodes agree on the state of the system.

3. **Availability:** - Guaranteeing that every request receives a response, without the assurance that it contains the most recent version of data.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Dynamo-style Ring Hashing, Consistent Hashing
   - Data replication strategies and decentralized architectures are used to ensure high availability.

4. **Latency:** - The inherent delay in propagating data across distributed nodes, which can affect performance and real-time operations.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)
   - Solutions like caching, content delivery networks (CDNs), and DHTs can reduce latency by making data retrieval more efficient and localized.

5. **Fault Tolerance:** - The system's ability to operate and recover correctly even when some of its components fail.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Checkpointing, Reed-Solomon error correction
   - Techniques like replication, checkpointing, and erasure coding help systems recover from faults.

6. **Scalability:** - The challenge of maintaining performance as the system grows in nodes, data volume, or transaction rate.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Sharding, Distributed Hash Tables
   - Solutions include horizontal scaling through sharding and the use of load balancers to distribute requests.

7. **Security:** - Protecting the system from malicious attacks, eavesdropping, or unauthorized access.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Merkle Trees, Digital Signatures
   - Cryptographic techniques, secure hashing, and public-key infrastructures (PKIs) enhance security.

8. **Data Replication:** - Ensuring data copies across multiple nodes while considering storage costs, synchronization, and potential data divergence.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Quorum-based replication, Merkle Trees
   - Replication strategies (like master-slave or peer-to-peer), and conflict resolution algorithms ensure consistent data copies.

9. **Leader Election:** - In systems where a coordinator or leader is needed, the challenge is how to elect one, especially when nodes can come and go or fail.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Bully Algorithm, Ring Algorithm
   - Various leader election algorithms ensure that a new leader is chosen when needed, with guarantees against having multiple leaders.

10. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** - The ability of the system to function correctly even when some nodes behave maliciously or erratically.
   - **Data Structures/Algorithms:** Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), HoneyBadgerBFT
   - Solutions involve algorithms that can reach consensus even when a subset of nodes is behaving maliciously.
